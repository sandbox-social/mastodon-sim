# This script retrieves public timelines (toots) from a social sandbox API.  # noqa: D100
# It sends a GET request to the API and fetches posts in batches with a specified limit.
# The results are stored in a list, converted into a DataFrame, and displayed.
# The script includes pagination logic to fetch all available data by adjusting the 'max_id' in the request parameters.
# Data for each toot includes the ID, creation time, content, whether it's a reply, sensitivity, and mentions.
# The process continues until no more toots are available, i.e., the last batch returns fewer items than the limit.
