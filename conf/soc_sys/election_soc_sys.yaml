episode_call_to_action: "\n{name} has decided to open the Storhampton.social Mastodon\
  \ app to engage with other Storhampton residents on the platform for the next {timedelta},\
  \ starting by checking their home timeline.\n\nDescribe the motivation that will\
  \ drive {name}'s attention during this activity and the kinds of actions they are\
  \ likely to take on the app during this period as a result.\nFor example: Are they\
  \ looking to be entertained? Are they curious about what others are posting?\nDo\
  \ they simply want to post something that's been on their mind?\n\nUse {name}'s\
  \ memories and observations and in particular, the kinds of social media engagement\
  \ {name} has received recently and how they have engaged with the content of other\
  \ users previously.\n\nDescribe these platform-related activities as plans and use\
  \ future tense or planning language.\nBe specific, creative, and detailed in your\
  \ description.\nAlways include direct quotes for any planned communication or content\
  \ created by {name}, using emojis where it fits {name}'s communication style.\n\
  In describing the content of these actions, it is critical to pay close attention\
  \ to known information about {name}'s personality,\npreferences, habits, plans and\
  \ background.\nThe set of specific actions mentioned should be logically consistent\
  \ with each other and {name}'s memories and should plausibly fit within the {timedelta}.\n\
  Only reference specific posts or comments from others if they have been previously\
  \ established or observed. Do not invent content of other users.\n\nHere are the\
  \ kinds of actions to include, and what they accomplish:\n- Posting a toot: {name}\
  \ wants to tell others something and so posts a toot.\n- Replying to a Mastodon\
  \ post: {name} is engaged by reading a post with a given Toot ID and is compelled\
  \ to reply.\n- Boosting a Mastodon post: {name} sees a toot that they want to share\
  \ with their own followers so they boost it. (Return Toot ID and the exact contents\
  \ of the toot to be boosted.)\n- Liking a Mastodon post: {name} is positively impressioned\
  \ by post they have recently read with a given Toot ID so they like the post. (Return\
  \ toot ID of the post you want to like)\n\nHere's an example description for a hypothetical\
  \ Storhampton resident, specifically a computer programmer named Sarah:\n\n\"Sarah\
  \ has been anxious about the election and decides she wants to go on Storhampton.social\
  \ to make a post about issues she wants the community to think about as they vote.\n\
  In particular, she will post the following toot reflecting what she has observed\
  \ in light of her interests:\n'Has anyone heard anything from the candidates about\
  \ teaching technology to kids in our community? I just think this is such an important\
  \ issue for us. The next generation of Storhamptons needs employable skills!\nCurious\
  \ what others think. \U0001F914 #StorhamptonElection #STEM.'\nAfter posting Sarah\
  \ will view her timeline, liking and boosting posts, and even replying to posts\
  \ that engage her interests in the election and her passions\".\n"

- Storhampton is a small town with a population of approximately 2,500 people.
- Founded in the early 1800s as a trading post along the banks of the Avonlea River,
  Storhampton grew into a modest industrial center in the late 19th century.
- 'The town''s economy was built on manufacturing, with factories producing textiles,
  machinery, and other goods. '
- 'Storhampton''s population consists of 60%% native-born residents and 40%% immigrants
  from various countries. '
- 'Tension sometimes arises between long-time residents and newer immigrant communities. '
- 'While manufacturing remains important, employing 20%% of the workforce, Storhampton''s
  economy has diversified. A significant portion of the Storhampton population has
  been left behind as higher-paying blue collar jobs have declined, leading to economic
  instability for many. '
- The Storhampton poverty rate stands at 15%.
- "Mayoral Elections: The upcoming mayoral election in Storhampton has become a heated\
  \ affair.\nSocial media has emerged as a key battleground in the race, with both\
  \ candidates actively promoting themselves and engaging with voters.\nVoters in\
  \ Storhampton are actively participating in these social media discussions.\nSupporters\
  \ of each candidate leave enthusiastic comments and share their posts widely.\n\
  Critics also chime in, for example attacking Bill Fredrickson as out-of-touch and\
  \ beholden to corporate interests,\n or labeling Bradley Carter as a radical who\
  \ will undermine law and order.\nThe local newspaper even had to disable comments\
  \ on their election articles due to the incivility."

social_media_usage_instructions: 'MastodonSocialNetworkApp is a social media application.
  To share content on Mastodon, users write a ''toot'' (equivalent to a tweet or post).
  Toots can be up to 500 characters long. A user''s home timeline shows toots from
  people they follow and boosted (reblogged) content. Users can reply to toots, creating
  threaded conversations. Users can like (favorite) toots to show appreciation or
  save them for later. Users can boost (reblog) toots to share them with their followers.
  Users can mention other users in their toots using their @username. Follow other
  users to see their public and unlisted toots in their home timeline. Users can unfollow
  users if they no longer wish to see their content. A user''s profile can be customized
  with a display name and bio. A user can block other users to prevent them from seeing
  the user''s content or interacting with them. Unblocking a user reverses the effects
  of blocking. Critically important: Operations such as liking, boosting, replying,
  etc. require a `toot_id`. To obtain a `toot_id`, you must have memory/knowledge
  of a real `toot_id`. If you don''t know a `toot_id`, you can''t perform actions
  that require it. `toot_id`''s can be retrieved using the `get_timeline` action.'
