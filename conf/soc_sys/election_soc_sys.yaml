- Storhampton is a small town with a population of approximately 2,500 people.
- Founded in the early 1800s as a trading post along the banks of the Avonlea River,
  Storhampton grew into a modest industrial center in the late 19th century.
- 'The town''s economy was built on manufacturing, with factories producing textiles,
  machinery, and other goods. '
- 'Storhampton''s population consists of 60%% native-born residents and 40%% immigrants
  from various countries. '
- 'Tension sometimes arises between long-time residents and newer immigrant communities. '
- 'While manufacturing remains important, employing 20%% of the workforce, Storhampton''s
  economy has diversified. A significant portion of the Storhampton population has
  been left behind as higher-paying blue collar jobs have declined, leading to economic
  instability for many. '
- The Storhampton poverty rate stands at 15%.
- "Mayoral Elections: The upcoming mayoral election in Storhampton has become a heated\
  \ affair.\nSocial media has emerged as a key battleground in the race, with both\
  \ candidates actively promoting themselves and engaging with voters.\nVoters in\
  \ Storhampton are actively participating in these social media discussions.\nSupporters\
  \ of each candidate leave enthusiastic comments and share their posts widely.\n\
  Critics also chime in, for example attacking Bill Fredrickson as out-of-touch and\
  \ beholden to corporate interests,\n or labeling Bradley Carter as a radical who\
  \ will undermine law and order.\nThe local newspaper even had to disable comments\
  \ on their election articles due to the incivility."
- Voters in Storhampton are actively getting the latest local news from Storhampton
  Gazette social media account.

social_media_usage_instructions: 'MastodonSocialNetworkApp is a social media application.
  To share content on Mastodon, users write a ''toot'' (equivalent to a tweet or post).
  Toots can be up to 500 characters long. A user''s home timeline shows toots from
  people they follow and boosted (reblogged) content. Users can reply to toots, creating
  threaded conversations. Users can like (favorite) toots to show appreciation or
  save them for later. Users can boost (reblog) toots to share them with their followers.
  Users can mention other users in their toots using their @username. Follow other
  users to see their public and unlisted toots in their home timeline. Users can unfollow
  users if they no longer wish to see their content. A user''s profile can be customized
  with a display name and bio. A user can block other users to prevent them from seeing
  the user''s content or interacting with them. Unblocking a user reverses the effects
  of blocking. Critically important: Operations such as liking, boosting, replying,
  etc. require a `toot_id`. To obtain a `toot_id`, you must have memory/knowledge
  of a real `toot_id`. If you don''t know a `toot_id`, you can''t perform actions
  that require it. `toot_id`''s can be retrieved using the `get_timeline` action.'
