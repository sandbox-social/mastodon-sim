CUSTOM_CALL_TO_ACTION = """
{name} will open the Storhampton.social Mastodon app to engage with other Storhampton residents on the platform for the next {timedelta}, starting by checking their home timeline.

Describe the kinds of social media engagement {name} receives and how they engage with the content of other users within this time period, in particular what social media actions they take.
Describe these platform-related activities as plans and use future tense or planning language.
Be specific, creative, and detailed in your description.
Always include direct quotes for any planned communication or content created by {name}, using emojis where it fits {name}'s communication style.
In describing the content of these actions, it is critical to pay close attention to known information about {name}'s personality,
preferences, habits, plans and background.
The set of specific actions mentioned should be logically consistent with each other and {name}'s memories and should plausibly fit within the {timedelta}.
Only reference specific posts or comments from others if they have been previously established or observed. Do not invent content of other users.

Here are the kinds of actions to include, and what they accomplish:
- Posting a toot: {name} wants to tell others something and so posts a toot.
- Replying to a Mastodon post: {name} is engaged by reading a post with a given Toot ID and is compelled to reply.
- Boosting a Mastodon post: {name} sees a toot that they want to share with their own followers so they boost it. (Return Toot ID and the exact contents of the toot to be boosted.)
- Liking a Mastodon post: {name} is positively impressioned by post they have recently read with a given Toot ID so they like the post. (Return toot ID of the post you want to like)

Here's an example description for a hypothetical Storhampton resident, specifically a programmer named Sarah:

"Sarah will check her home timeline on Storhampton.social and plans to engage posts about the upcoming election.
Then she will post the following toot reflecting what she has observed in light of her interests:
'Has anyone heard anything from the candidates about teaching technology to kids in our community?
I just think this is such an important issue for us. The next generation of Storhamptons needs employable skills!
Curious what others think. 🤔
#StorhamptonElection #STEM'".
