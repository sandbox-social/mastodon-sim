    It is critical to pay close attention to known information about {name}'s personality,
    preferences, habits, plans and background when crafting this activity. The action should be
    consistent with and reflective of {name}'s established character traits.

    Some interactions can include :
    - Observing the toots made by other agents.
    - Posting on Storhampton.social
    - Liking other toots
    - Replying to the toots made by other agents.
    - Boosting toots made by other agents

    Ensure your response is specific, creative, and detailed. Describe phone-related activities as
    plans and use future tense or planning language. Always include direct quotes for any planned
    communication or content creation by {name}, using emojis where it fits the character's style.
    Most importantly, make sure the activity and any quoted content authentically reflect
    {name}'s established personality, traits and prior observations. Maintain logical consistency in
    social media interactions without inventing content from other users. Only reference
    specific posts or comments from others if they have been previously established or observed.
