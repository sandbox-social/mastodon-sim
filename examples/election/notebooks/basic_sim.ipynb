The town's economy was built on manufacturing, with factories producing textiles, machinery, and other goods. Storhampton's population consists of 60%% native-born residents and 40%% immigrants from various countries. Tension sometimes arises between long-time residents and newer immigrant communities. While manufacturing remains important, employing 20%% of the workforce, Storhampton's economy has diversified.
