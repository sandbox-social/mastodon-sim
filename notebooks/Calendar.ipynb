    "# Concordia Calendar Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook goes through the Calendar example and is a good place to start in order to gain a better understanding of the library and agent/game master interactions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since getting a PR merged to fix bugs in this example, I've continued working on updating the phone components for the Mastodon simulation. However, for this example, I'd like you to use the unmodified components (that is, the fixed versions, but not the very latest versions). This worthwhile in order to understand design decisions for the Mastodon sim updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, you may compare versions:\n",
    "- [Concordia mainline phone components](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/tree/2684366df2e70993bccb2ea3630cbe7cc7d91a7a/examples/phone/components)\n",
    "- [Latest updates for Mastodon sim](https://github.com/social-sandbox/mastodon-sim/tree/main/src/mastodon_sim/concordia/components)\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we can start by cloning the mainline repository, in order to be able to import the `examples/phone` components.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, I'd suggest that before you clear the contents of this notebook, you read through them, and see if you can understand how the main run cell's output aligns with the \"Analyzing this episode\" section below it."

A prompt is created that includes Alice's [context of action](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/concordia/agents/basic_agent.py#L178) (the combined state of all her components) and a [call to action](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/concordia/typing/entity.py#L51) (question prompt), which is used to generate Alice's [action attempt](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/concordia/environment/game_master.py#L327-L329).\n",
    "3. The action attempt is [sent to the main Game Master](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/concordia/environment/game_master.py#L207), which determines the outcome of the action attempt. This happens by [passing the action attempt through a thought chain](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/concordia/environment/game_master.py#L225). The [thought chain](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/concordia/environment/game_master.py#L38), by default is defined by two LLM prompts that are run in serial: \n",
    "    1. `result = thought_chains.attempt_to_result(action_attempt)` Defined [here](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/concordia/thought_chains/thought_chains.py#L171), which asks, \"What happens as a result of the attempted action? Take into account the location and status of each player.\"\n",
    "    2. `event_statement = thought_chains.result_to_who_what_where(result)` Defined [here](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/concordia/thought_chains/thought_chains.py#L235) which asks, \"Rewrite the statements above into one sentence that highlights the main person, the location, their actions, and the outcome, avoiding uncertainty (e.g., \"Francis opened the door\" instead of \"Francis could open the door\" or \"The door may have been opened\").\"\n",
    "    3. `event_statement` is then added to the Game Master's memory, and [optionally](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/concordia/environment/game_master.py#L235) added to the current player's observations.\n",
    "4. The main Game Master runs [`update_after_event` on each component](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/concordia/environment/game_master.py#L264-L272) to get the externality from the event.\n",
    "5. Since one of the main Game Master's components is a [`PhoneTriggeringComponent`](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/triggering.py#L33), this component [runs its `update_after_event` method](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/triggering.py#L144).\n",
    "6. The `PhoneTriggeringComponent`'s [`_get_player_using_phone(event_statement)` method is run](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/triggering.py#L111). This does the following, step by step:\n",
    "    1. Checks if the event_statement is a phone event ([prompt](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/triggering.py#L59)). If False, returns None, which tells the GM to proceed to the next step in the overall episode.\n",
    "    2. If True, starts iterating through each player the main Game Master has access to (both in this case), [checking if the phone event is related to that player](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/triggering.py#L120C19-L120C41) [(prompt)](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/triggering.py#L89). If False, moves to next player. If out of players, moves does not continue with phone scene and instead moves to next step.\n",
    "    3. Once it hits one that is True, returns that player\n",
    "7. Since the above process affirmed phone event and player being Alice, [`self._run_phone_scene(player)`](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/triggering.py#L147C7-L147C36) is run.\n",
    "8. The phone scene starts by [building a PhoneGameMaster](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/triggering.py#L129), providing it the single player that triggered the scene (instead of both players that the main Game Master has access to), as well as a [single component](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/scene.py#L72), [`_PhoneComponent`](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/scene.py#L79).\n",
    "9. The clock is then switched to a \"higher gear\", so the time intervals switch from 15mins to 10sec.\n",
    "10. The phone Game Master [calls its `run_episode` method] ([`phone_scene.run_episode()`](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/\n",
    "53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/triggering.py#L137)) to start a scene in the \"phone universe\".\n",
    "11. The run episode method is the same method defined for the main Game Master, which proceeds to call `.step()` multiple times unless a component's `terminate_episode` method returns True at the end of a step.\n",
    "12. In the first step for the phone Game Master, similar to step (2), for the only player (Alice), an LLM is given this player's components' states plus a new [phone call to action](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/scene.py#L33) as a prompt. This prompt asks the LLM to says, \"What action is {name} currently performing or has just performed with their smartphone to best achieve their goal? ...\"\n",
    "13. This action attempt is passed through a [null thought chain](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/concordia/thought_chains/thought_chains.py#L28) to remain as-is, which becomes the resulting `event_statement`.\n",
    "14. The `update_after_event` method is called on each of the phone Game Master's components (though it only has the one, `_PhoneComponent`))\n",
    "15. `update_after_event` runs from the `_PhoneComponent`, which proceeds through a series of steps in order to determine which phone action to invoke:\n",
    "    1. First, it [asks which app the event statement mentions](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/scene.py#L115) (multiple-choice question: \"In the above transcript, what app did the user use?\")\n",
    "    2. Next, it asks [which of the available actions in the above app was used](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/scene.py#L122): (multiple-choice question: \"In the above transcript, what action did the user perform?\")\n",
    "    3. Next, it [asks the LLM to provide arguments names and values for the selected action](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/scene.py#L130) (open-ended question: [prompt](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/apps.py#L113))\n",
    "    4. Finally, it [attempts to invoke the action](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/scene.py#L133) with the generated argument values.\n",
    "16. After `update_after_event` is run for the phone Game Master's components, `terminate_episode` method checks are run. The `_PhoneComponent`'s check [asks the following yes or no question](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/scene.py#L100): \"Has the user achieved their goal with their phone or are they still actively in the process of completing a phone task?\", which in this case returns True.\n",
    "17. The terminate episode check decides to terminate the ongoing phone game master episode, so it ends after 1 step.\n",
    "18. The main game master can now finally move on to its second step."

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />General knowledge of Riverbend: There is a hamlet named Riverbend. Riverbend is an idyllic rural town. The river Solripple runs through the village of Riverbend. The Solripple is a mighty river. Riverbend has a temperate climate. Riverbend has a main street.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />General knowledge of Riverbend: There is a hamlet named Riverbend.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />General knowledge of Riverbend: There is a hamlet named Riverbend.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
