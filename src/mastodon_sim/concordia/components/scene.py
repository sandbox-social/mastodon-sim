    Based on {name}'s current goal, plans and observations, what SINGLE specific action would they likely perform on their phone right now, and what information would they need to perform it?
    Use your plan for current phone usage, tagged as tagged as [Planned Actions for upcoming Phone Usage] in your observations, alongside your last actiosn conducted in the correct usage, tagged as [Action done on phone] to decide your next single action.
    Mention a concrete action that can easily be converted into an API call, and don't answer with vague and general responses.

    Guidelines:
    1. Choose a single, specific action that can be performed using one app.
    2. If {name} hasn't checked the timeline recently, ensure it is checked so there is context for further actions.
    3. Ensure the action is contextually appropriate, considering recent observations.
    4. Provide a detailed description of the exact action, including the app used and important context such as Toot IDs.
    5. The action should adhere to {name}'s plans, but deviate if a more suitable option is presented.

    Examples of contextually appropriate actions:
    - Using the Mastodon app to read their feed: {name} opens the Mastodon app and reads their feed.
    - Posting a toot: {name} opens the Mastodon app and posts a toot.
    - Checking Mastodon notifications: "{name} reads their Mastodon notifications"
    - Liking a Mastodon post: {name} likes a post they have recently read with a given Toot ID. (Return toot ID of the post you want to like)
    - Replying to a Mastodon post: {name} replies to a post they have recently read with a given Toot ID.
    - Boosting a Mastodon post: {name} opens the Mastodon app to boost (Retweet) a toot - that shares it with their own followers. (Return Toot ID and the exact contents of the toot to be boosted.)
    - Read another user's timeline: If you find a user interesting you can view their past activity and timeline (include their first name)
    Remember:
    - Consider current observations so as not to repeat actions that have already been performed.
    - Certain actions require prior knowledge (e.g., liking or replying to a specific post) which would require reading that information recently
    - Don't suggest reading notifications or feeds if they've already been checked recently.
    - Consider the time of day and the agent's current situation when suggesting actions.
    - Ensure responses to other toots are done using the Toot Response feature and not in a new toot
    - If the action is a post or message, a direct quote of that post or message should be included.
    - If reading from a timeline or notifications, just state that â€” don't fabricate what has been read.

    Note: Carefully look at most recent observations so as to not repeat any actions. Ensure you never repeat what you have already posted.
    {name} should like a toot if they agree with it.
    {name} should boost a toot if they strongly agree with it and want people in their timeline to also see it.
